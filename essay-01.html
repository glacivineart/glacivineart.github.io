<h1>a kiss is the beginning of cannibalism</h1>

<p>
they met in the city, under the jaundiced light of a flickering streetlamp. rain kissed the sidewalks, and cigarette smoke curled in the alley behind them like a phantom. when she looked up at him, she didn’t see a man, but rather hunger with skin stretched over it.
</p>

<p>
he was charming in a way only the damned could be. every word he spoke tasted like blood and velvet. she of course mistook it for poetry. they spoke until the sky bled pale and the rats retreated into their dark corners. the next night she invited him in. the next week, he never left. he didn’t eat. he only watched her eat, his eyes lingering too long on her lips, her teeth, the pink insides of her mouth
</p>

<p>
she joked once, “you look at me like you want to devour me“. he smiled but didn’t laugh..<br>
then came the kiss.
</p>

<p>
it was late, and the air between them had fermented into something close to need. she leaned in, slow and cautious, but he was already there. his lips met hers, soft at first. but his mouth opened too wide. his teeth grazed her tongue. she pulled away, a sliver of pain blooming at the corner of her lip.
</p>

<p>
‘‘you bit me,” she whispered, a hand rising to her mouth.
<p>

<p>
he wiped her blood from his chin with a thumb and sucked it clean. he didn’t kill her. not that night. but each kiss after took something, small, vital pieces. the curve of her collarbone. her fingertips. the soft flesh behind her knees. she didn’t scream. not aloud.  
<p>

<p>
she told herself it was love. she told herself this was intimacy. she learnt how to kiss with her eyes closed. she wasn’t herself anymore. she was what was left of her. hollowed. tenderized. worshiped in the way only predators worship prey. slowly, reverently, completely.
